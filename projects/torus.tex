\textbf{Torus Hardware Accelerator} (\href{https://github.com/GiuseppeCalderonio/HPPS_Project}{Available here})  \hfill Mar 2022 - Jun 2022 \\
\textit{Computer Architectures II Project, Politecnico di Milano}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Hardware accelerator designed in Chisel featuring a Torus topology optimized for parallel data exchange.
    \item Topology supports a configurable number of dimensions, ranging from 1 to 5. Each processing element incorporates a number of memories linear to the dimension chosen, facilitating parallel data communication among adjacent components in a single clock cycle.
    \item Programmed in Scala, benchmarked up to 36 processing elements, reaching 239.99 Bytes/clock throughput with an aggregated bandwidth of 576 Bytes.

\end{itemize}
