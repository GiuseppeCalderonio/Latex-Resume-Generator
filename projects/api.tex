\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item  Command line text editor in C supporting the following 5 instructions : read, write, delete, undo, redo.
    \item  Algorithm implemented using a C array, exhibiting linear time and space complexity with respect to the array length for each operation in the worst-case scenario.
    \item  Tested over a private test case suite with Time and Space complexity constraints.
\end{itemize}
