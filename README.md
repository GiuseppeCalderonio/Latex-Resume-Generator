# Latex Resume Generator

This is a template to generate a resume with latex, used for creating different resumes tailored for specific positions, 
including general info such as education and work experiences, and allowing the flexibility to change dynamically 
the projects based on the specific position.

The ```compile.sh``` script compiles all the resumes and generates the .pdf file, assuming that all the main files
start with ```CV-``` and end with ```.tex```
